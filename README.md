# Healthcare Data Management and Patient-Doctor Interaction System

The Healthcare Data Management and Patient-Doctor Interaction System is an integrated platform that leverages cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize healthcare data management and enhance interactions between patients and healthcare providers. This comprehensive solution addresses critical gaps in the current healthcare system, offering enhanced security, efficiency, and collaboration.

## Features

- **Frontend Web Application Interface**: User-friendly interface developed using React.js, offering intuitive forms, input fields, and validation mechanisms for accurate and secure data entry.
  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Integration**: Automated analysis of patient-doctor conversations to extract pertinent medical information, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of symptom documentation.

- **Mapping Functions for Symptom-Drug Correlation and Drug-Drug Interaction**: Analysis of patient health records stored on the blockchain to identify potential issues such as adverse drug events and drug-drug interactions.

- **Connecting to Ethereum Account via Metamask**: Establishes a secure connection to the Ethereum blockchain, facilitating seamless interaction with Ethereum-based functionalities for secure storage and retrieval of patient health records.

- **Formatting Data and Utilizing Pinata API**: Formats and securely transmits health history data to IPFS storage using the Pinata API, leveraging decentralized storage for enhanced security and reliability.

- **Obtaining Content Identifier (CID) from IPFS**: Generates a unique CID as a reference point for each set of patient health records, ensuring data integrity and tamper-proofing of stored data.

- **Using Smart Contract for Data Management on Blockchain**: Establishes a decentralized and tamper-proof system for managing patient health records, ensuring transparency, accountability, and immutability of healthcare data.

- **CID Retrieval and Sharing**: Facilitates secure and efficient communication between patients and healthcare providers, empowering patients to control access permissions to their health records.

- **Accessing Medical Data from IPFS**: Enables healthcare providers to securely access patient health records stored on IPFS, safeguarding patient privacy and trust through robust encryption mechanisms.

- **Tracking CID Requests and Sharing**: Fosters transparency, accountability, and patient empowerment within the healthcare ecosystem, enabling proactive engagement from patients in managing access permissions to their health records.
